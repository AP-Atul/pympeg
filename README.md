# pympeg (python + ffmpeg)
A simple to use ffmpeg binding in python. Simple filters command can beimplemented using simple functions without worrying about the ffmpeg syntax.
Useful in situation when you know how to construct ffmpeg command but don't want it to look ugly for loops. 

## Existence
* We are creating the alternative to the entire ffmpeg command line experience, but a rather easy way tu put the same syntax in python.
* This library encorages the user to use the ffmpeg documentation to come up with a query and then use the functions we provide to put it neatly.

## Under development
Yes! all/any contributions are welcome.
